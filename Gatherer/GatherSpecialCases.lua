	Special Case Handling
	
	This file handles modifications that need to be made to various data tables
	throughout Gatherer that need to be "hacked up" in some fashion to handle
	Special Case nodes.
	
	THIS FILE SHOULD ALWAYS BE HEAVILY COMMENTED SO THAT IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND
	EXACTLY WHAT IS BEING DONE AND WHY!!!
